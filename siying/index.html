  <p>Hello mama penguin ! Happy 1 year older !
Thanks for adopting ur two lil baby birds. It’s really nice to have someone to annoy and disturb 24/7, and talk nonsense with occasionally till like 0000H :”) and also sneaking into your room in the middle of the night (just twice) hope that u won’t abandon us anytime soon. But don’t miss us too much as well !
You were probably one of the best human creation I’ve ever met. 老一岁咯！

  To my fellow injured buddy: Happy 23rd!!! Nine weeks have passed by and I'm super grateful for your friendship -- for nights spent chilling at the mess or just being degen, running away from *homing missiles*, for tolerating my nonsense no matter the time of day. Thank you for being a da jie away from home and nursing me through the worst of my injury (i really am sorry for being such a burden haha). All said, it's been a privilege working alongside you in shaping 3rd ADW; I've learnt a lot from you and it's been great time of 2x Bai Ka all around. Speedy recovery for your knee and all the best in Chong Pang, and I'll see you soon for GCM!!
