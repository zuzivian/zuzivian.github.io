  <p>Hello mama penguin ! Happy 1 year older !
Thanks for adopting ur two lil baby birds. It’s really nice to have someone to annoy and disturb 24/7, and talk nonsense with occasionally till like 0000H :”) and also sneaking into your room in the middle of the night (just twice) hope that u won’t abandon us anytime soon. But don’t miss us too much as well !
You were probably one of the best human creation I’ve ever met. 老一岁咯！

  To my fellow injured buddy -- Happy 23rd!!! Nine weeks have passed by, and I'm super grateful for all the nonsense we've been up to for the past few weeks thanks for being a da jie away from home and nursing me to. (sorry for being a burden haha) Speedy recovery and all the best in Chong Pang, and I'll see you soon for GCM!!
