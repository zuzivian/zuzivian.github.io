  <p>Hello mama penguin ! Happy 1 year older !
Thanks for adopting ur two lil baby birds. It’s really nice to have someone to annoy and disturb 24/7, and talk nonsense with occasionally till like 0000H :”) and also sneaking into your room in the middle of the night (just twice) hope that u won’t abandon us anytime soon. But don’t miss us too much as well !
You were probably one of the best human creation I’ve ever met. 老一岁咯！

  To my fellow injured buddy: Happy 23rd!!! Nine weeks have passed by and I'm super grateful for your friendship -- for nights spent chilling at the mess or just being degen, running away from *homing missiles*, for tolerating my nonsense no matter the time of day. Thanks for being a da jie away from home and nursing me through the worst of my injury (i really am sorry for being such a burden haha). All said, it's been a privilege working alongside you in shaping 3rd ADW; it's been great time of 2x Bai Ka all around. Speedy recovery for your knee and all the best in Chong Pang, and I'll see you soon for GCM!!
