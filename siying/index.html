  <p>Hello mama penguin ! Happy 1 year older ! 
Thanks for adopting ur two lil baby birds. It’s really nice to have someone to annoy and disturb 24/7, and talk nonsense with occasionally till like 0000H :”) and also sneaking into your room in the middle of the night (just twice) hope that u won’t abandon us anytime soon. But don’t miss us too much as well ! 
You were probably one of the best human creation I’ve ever met. 老一岁咯！
